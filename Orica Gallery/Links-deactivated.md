This is Pouriya, Head of Tech from Orica company, an Ethical NFT platform.

We wish to report a serious Decentraland issue. All links in our parcel function perfectly with low visitor traffic (links are connected to every NFT, 
if user would like to purchase that NFT, easily can click on it and redirect it for purchase process, these links work just when there is up to 2 or 3 users 
in the gallery, as long as the users are more, then all links won't work). However, with any significant visitor numbers the links stop working entirely. 
We have run three events in the space so far since launching in April (peak traffic 71. 75 and 45) and each time the links have failed.

**This issue is critical to the commercial activities on our parcel. How can we resolve this with Decentraland?**
